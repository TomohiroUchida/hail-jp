# Files for hail-jp that ut used.
There are the files used for hail-jp seminar and other purposes in this repository.
The 'Gwas tutorial' was made by hail team in https://github.com/hail-is/hail under MIT license.
My Gwas tutorial file has been translated into Japanese and has some additional steps to help you better understand it while paying homage to the original.

This repository also include 'How to install Hail'.
I tested linux, windows on WSL , windows using Docker, macos Intel/m1 and so on.
It is good starting point to start Hail.
